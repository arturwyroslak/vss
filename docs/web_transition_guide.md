# Transition Guide: Desktop to Web Application

## Introduction

This document outlines the changes made during the transition of our application from a desktop to a web-based platform. The transition involved significant modifications, including the removal of certain scripts and adjustments to extensions, to better suit the web environment. This guide serves to provide clarity on these changes and the reasoning behind them.

## Removed Scripts

### `fixWSLNew.ps1`

- **Description**: This PowerShell script was initially designed to configure the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment for the desktop version of the application.
- **Rationale for Removal**: With the transition to a web application, the need to configure WSL environments is eliminated. The web application architecture does not rely on local development environments specific to Windows, making this script obsolete.

## Modified Extensions

### `ms-vscode.js-debug`

- **Modification**: Comments were added to the README.md file to omit the section regarding WebView2 support.
- **Rationale**: WebView2 is a control for embedding web content in desktop applications. Given the shift to a fully web-based model, references to desktop-specific features like WebView2 are not applicable. This modification aims to prevent confusion and focus on web-relevant functionalities.

## General Notes

The transition from a desktop to a web application presented a unique set of challenges and opportunities. One of the primary motivations was to leverage the accessibility and scalability of web platforms. Throughout this process, we prioritized maintaining the core functionality of the application while optimizing for the web environment.

### Future Directions

As we continue to evolve the application, we will explore further enhancements to improve performance, usability, and integration capabilities. The transition to the web opens up new possibilities for collaboration and deployment that we are eager to explore.

### Conclusion

This guide provides an overview of the key changes made during the transition of our application to the web. By understanding the modifications and their rationale, developers and maintainers can better navigate the current architecture and contribute to future developments.
